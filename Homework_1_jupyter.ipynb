      "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and a leading cause of death from cancer\n",

      "breastfeeding may be more protective of some invasive breast cancer types. The purpose of this\n",
      "review is to discuss breast cancer disparities in the context of breastfeeding and the implications for\n",
      "black mothers. Black women in the U.S. have lower rates of breastfeeding and nearly twice the rates\n",
      "of triple-negative breast cancer (an aggressive subtype) compared with white women. In addition to\n",
      "individual challenges to breastfeeding, black women may also differentially face contextual barriers\n",
      "such as a lack of social and cultural acceptance in their communities, inadequate support from the\n",
      "healthcare community, and unsupportive work environments. More work is needed to improve the\n",
      "social factors and policies that influence breastfeeding rates at a population level. Such efforts should\n",
      "give special consideration to the needs of black mothers to adequately address disparities in\n",
      "breastfeeding among this group and possibly help reduce breast cancer risk. Interventions such as\n",
      "peer counseling, hospital policy changes, breastfeeding-specific clinic appointments, group prenatal\n",
      "education, and enhanced breastfeeding programs have been shown to be effective in communities of\n",
      "color. A comprehensive approach that integrates interventions across multiple levels and settings\n",
      "may be most successful in helping mothers reach their breastfeeding goals and reducing disparities\n",

      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "Breastfeeding has become a well-documented protective\n",
      "factor for breast cancer. Black women not only have lower\n",
      "rates of breastfeeding compared with white women, but\n",
      "they are also disproportionally affected by triple-negative\n",
      "breast cancer, an aggressive subtype. From a public health\n",
      "perspective, the evidence linking breastfeeding to cancer\n",
      "risk adds to the importance of ensuring all women have\n",
      "the necessary supports in place to meet their breastfeeding\n",
      "goals. More work is needed to improve the contextual\n",
      "factors that influence breastfeeding rates at a population\n",
      "level. Efforts to do so should give special consideration to\n",
      "the needs of black women to address breastfeeding\n",
      "disparities among this group and potentially contribute\n",
      "to reductions in breast cancer incidence. Interventions\n",
      "such as peer counseling, hospital policy changes,\n",
      "breastfeeding-specific clinic appointments, group prenatal\n",
      "education, and enhanced breastfeeding programs have\n",
      "been shown to be effective in communities of color.52 A\n",
      "comprehensive approach is needed to integrate interven-\n",
      "tions across multiple levels (national, state, and local) and\n",
      "settings to help women to reach their breastfeeding goals.\n",
      "By reducing breastfeeding disparities and the incidence of\n",
      "aggressive breast cancers among black women, there could\n",
      "be a reduction in the disparity of breast cancer mortality.\n",
